    <div id="intro">
        <p>Russian-born creative thinker, theatre performer, poet, and flash fiction writer, guitarist. I strongly believe in the value of creativity and self-expression since it brings about change in the world. My main focus in everything I do is to share
            experience from soul to soul since there is nothing more attractive and heartwarming than the soul one puts in their work where other people can definitely feel that. From the experience, we share there is always something beautiful that comes
            out of it and makes the world a better place. <br> I can always relate to anything that has a soul in it. </br>
